Welcome to my website! I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of IEOR at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/">Adam Elmachtoub</a>. Previously, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Nanjing University, followed by a M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University.

My research lies in revenue management and pricing, with a focus on reusable resources and choice models. I am also interested in data-driven decision making.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
