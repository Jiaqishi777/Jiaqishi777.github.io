 Welcome to my website! My name is Jiaqi Shi (施家奇 in Chinese) and I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of IEOR at Columbia University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/">Adam Elmachtoub</a>. Previously, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Nanjing University, followed by a M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University.

My research lies in revenue management and pricing, with a focus on reusable resources and choice models. I am also interested in data-driven decision making.
